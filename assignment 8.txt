assignment 8 

1. **Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?**
   - No, PyInputPlus is not part of the Python Standard Library. It is a third-party module that needs to be installed separately using `pip`.

2. **Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with `import pyinputplus as pypi`?**
   - PyInputPlus is often imported with an alias like `pypi` to shorten the module name, making it easier and quicker to use in code.

3. **How do you distinguish between `inputInt()` and `inputFloat()`?**
   - The `inputInt()` function ensures the user enters an integer, while `inputFloat()` allows for floating-point numbers (i.e., numbers with decimals).

4. **Using PyInputPlus how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?**
   - You can use the `inputInt(min=0, max=99)` function to ensure that the user enters an integer within that range.

5. **What is transferred to the keyword arguments `allowRegexes` and `blockRegexes`?**
   - `allowRegexes` and `blockRegexes` take lists of regular expression strings. `allowRegexes` allows specific patterns, while `blockRegexes` blocks inputs that match certain patterns.

6. **If a blank input is entered three times, what does `inputStr(limit=3)` do?**
   - If blank input is entered three times, `inputStr(limit=3)` raises a `RetryLimitException` because the input limit has been reached.

7. **If a blank input is entered three times, what does `inputStr(limit=3, default='hello')` do?**
   - If blank input is entered three times, `inputStr(limit=3, default='hello')` returns the default value `'hello'` instead of raising an exception.
