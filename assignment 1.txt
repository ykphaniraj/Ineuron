assignment 1

1. Values or Expressions:  
   `'hello'` – value (string)  
   `-87.8` – value (float)  
   `-` and `/` – expressions (operators)  
   `6` – value (integer)

2. Difference between String and Variable:  
   A string is a sequence of characters, while a variable is a name that stores data, which can include strings.

3. Three Data Types:  
   Integer (e.g., `5`), String (e.g., `'hello'`), and Boolean (`True` or `False`).

4. Expression:  
   An expression is made up of values and operators, and it evaluates to a value.

5. Expression vs. Statement:  
   An expression evaluates to a value, while a statement performs an action (e.g., assignment).

6. Value of `bacon`:  
   After running `bacon = 22` and `bacon + 1`, `bacon` still contains `22` because the result isn't assigned back to `bacon`.

7. Values of Expressions:  
   `'spam' + 'spamspam'` evaluates to `'spamspamspam'`  
   `'spam' * 3` evaluates to `'spamspamspam'`

8. Valid and Invalid Variable Names:  
   `eggs` is valid because it follows the variable naming rules. `100` is invalid because variable names cannot start with numbers.

9. Three Conversion Functions:  
   `int()` for integer, `float()` for floating-point, and `str()` for string.

10. Error and Fix in Expression:  
    `'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'` causes a type error. Fix it by converting `99` to a string: `'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'`.
