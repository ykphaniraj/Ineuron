 Q1
The two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.x are:
1. **Inheriting from `Exception`**: Custom exceptions should inherit from the built-in `Exception` class, ensuring they are part of the exception hierarchy.
2. **Using `__init__()`**: Custom exceptions can define an `__init__()` method to accept additional arguments, allowing for more informative error messages and context.

 Q2
Class-based exceptions that have been raised are matched to handlers by checking the exception type against the exception types specified in the `except` clauses. If the raised exception is an instance of the specified class or a subclass of it, the corresponding handler is executed.

 Q3
Two methods for attaching context information to exception artifacts include:
1. **Custom Attributes**: You can define custom attributes in your user-defined exception classes to hold additional context information.
2. **Using the `__context__` Attribute**: The built-in exception class automatically attaches context to the current exception, allowing you to access the original exception that caused the new one.

 Q4
Two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message are:
1. **Passing a String to the Exception Constructor**: When raising an exception, you can pass a string message as an argument to the exception's constructor.
2. **Overriding the `__str__()` Method**: You can define a `__str__()` method in your custom exception class to return a specific error message when the exception is converted to a string.

 Q5
String-based exceptions are no longer used because they lack the structure and flexibility provided by class-based exceptions. Using class-based exceptions allows for better organization, the ability to define multiple attributes and methods, and improved handling of different exception types through inheritance, making error handling more robust and maintainable.
