1. Print "Hello Python":
   ```python
   print("Hello Python")
   ```

2. Arithmetical operations (addition and division):
   ```python
   # Addition
   a = 10
   b = 5
   addition = a + b
   print("Addition:", addition)

   # Division
   division = a / b
   print("Division:", division)
   ```

3. Find the area of a triangle:
   ```python
   # Area = 0.5 * base * height
   base = 10
   height = 5
   area = 0.5 * base * height
   print("Area of the triangle:", area)
   ```

4. Swap two variables:
   ```python
   a = 5
   b = 10
   print("Before swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)

   # Swapping
   a, b = b, a

   print("After swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)
   ```

5. Generate a random number:
   ```python
   import random

   random_number = random.randint(1, 100)  # Generates a random number between 1 and 100
   print("Random number:", random_number)
   ```
