assignment 16


1. Create a list called `years_list`, starting with the year of your birth and until the year of your fifth birthday.
   ```python
   birth_year = 1990  # Replace this with your actual birth year
   years_list = [birth_year + i for i in range(6)]
   years_list
   ```
   Example: If birth year is 1990, `years_list = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995]`.

2. In which year in `years_list` was your third birthday?
   ```python
   third_birthday_year = years_list[3]
   third_birthday_year
   ```
   Solution: The third birthday is in the 4th element (index 3).

3. In the `years_list`, which year were you the oldest?
   ```python
   oldest_year = years_list[-1]
   oldest_year
   ```
   Solution: The last year in the list is when you were the oldest.

4. Make a list called `things` with the elements "mozzarella", "cinderella", and "salmonella".
   ```python
   things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]
   things
   ```

5. Capitalize the element in `things` that refers to a person (cinderella) and print the list.
   ```python
   things[1] = things[1].capitalize()
   things
   ```
   Did it change the element?: Yes, now `"Cinderella"` is capitalized in the list.

6. Make a `surprise` list with the elements "Groucho", "Chico", and "Harpo".
   ```python
   surprise = ["Groucho", "Chico", "Harpo"]
   ```

7. Lowercase the last element of the `surprise` list, reverse it, and then capitalize it.
   ```python
   last_element = surprise[-1].lower()[::-1].capitalize()
   last_element
   ```

8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called `e2f` and print it.
   ```python
   e2f = {'dog': 'chien', 'cat': 'chat', 'walrus': 'morse'}
   e2f
   ```

9. Write the French word for walrus from the dictionary `e2f`.
   ```python
   french_walrus = e2f['walrus']
   french_walrus
   ```

10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called `f2e` from `e2f` using the `items()` method.
   ```python
   f2e = {french: english for english, french in e2f.items()}
   f2e
   ```

11. Print the English version of the French word "chien" using `f2e`.
   ```python
   english_dog = f2e['chien']
   english_dog
   ```

12. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in `e2f`.
   ```python
   english_words = set(e2f.keys())
   english_words
   ```

13. Make a multilevel dictionary called `life`.
   ```python
   life = {
       'animals': {
           'cats': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'],
           'octopi': {},
           'emus': {}
       },
       'plants': {},
       'other': {}
   }
   ```

14. Print the top-level keys of `life`.
   ```python
   life_keys = life.keys()
   life_keys
   ```

15. Print the keys for `life['animals']`.
   ```python
   animals_keys = life['animals'].keys()
   animals_keys
   ```

16. Print the values for `life['animals']['cats']`.
   ```python
   cats = life['animals']['cats']
   cats
   ```
