Here are the answers to your questions:

 Q1
**Is an assignment operator like `+=` only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at runtime?**
No, the `+=` operator is not just for show; it can improve performance in certain situations. Using `+=` can be more efficient because it modifies the object in place when possible, avoiding the overhead of creating a new object.

 Q2
**What is the smallest number of statements you’d have to write in most programming languages to replace the Python expression `a, b = a + b, a`?**
In most programming languages, you would typically need at least three statements: one for the sum, one to assign the value to `a`, and one to assign the old value of `a` to `b`. 

 Q3
**In Python, what is the most effective way to set a list of 100 integers to 0?**
The most effective way to set a list of 100 integers to 0 is to use list multiplication:
```python
my_list = [0] * 100
```

 Q4
**What is the most effective way to initialize a list of 99 integers that repeats the sequence 1, 2, 3? If necessary, show step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish this.**
You can achieve this using list multiplication and slicing:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3] * 33 + [1]  # This gives you 99 elements: [1, 2, 3, ..., 1]
```

 Q5
**If you’re using IDLE to run a Python application, explain how to print a multidimensional list as efficiently?**
You can use a nested loop to print a multidimensional list efficiently:
```python
for row in my_list:
    print(row)
```
Alternatively, using a simple print statement:
```python
print(*my_list, sep='\n')
```

 Q6
**Is it possible to use list comprehension with a string? If so, how can you go about doing it?**
Yes, you can use list comprehension with a string to create a list of its characters or transform them. For example:
```python
char_list = [char for char in "hello"]
```

 Q7
**From the command line, how do you get support with a user-written Python program? Is this possible from inside IDLE?**
You can get help by using the `help()` function or accessing documentation. From the command line, you can run:
```bash
python -m pydoc mymodule
```
In IDLE, you can also use `help(mymodule)` or refer to the Python documentation.

 Q8
**Functions are said to be “first-class objects” in Python but not in most other languages, such as C++ or Java. What can you do in Python with a function (callable object) that you can’t do in C or C++?**
In Python, you can pass functions as arguments to other functions, return them from functions, and assign them to variables, which is not typically supported in C or C++.

 Q9
**How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?**
- A **wrapper** is a function that is used to modify or enhance another function's behavior.
- A **wrapped feature** refers to the original function that is being modified or enhanced by the wrapper.
- A **decorator** is a specific type of wrapper that is applied to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

 Q10
**If a function is a generator function, what does it return?**
A generator function returns a generator iterator, which produces values lazily, one at a time, using the `yield` statement instead of returning a value.

 Q11
**What is the one improvement that must be made to a function in order for it to become a generator function in the Python language?**
To become a generator function, it must include at least one `yield` statement instead of a `return` statement.

 Q12
**Identify at least one benefit of generators.**
One benefit of generators is that they allow for efficient memory usage by generating values on-the-fly instead of storing all values in memory at once, which is particularly useful for large datasets.
