assignment 9

1. To what does a relative path refer?
   - A relative path refers to a file or directory location relative to the current working directory.

2. What does an absolute path start with on your operating system?
   - An absolute path starts from the root directory. On Windows, it typically starts with a drive letter (e.g., `C:\`), and on Unix-like systems, it starts with `/`.

3. What do the functions `os.getcwd()` and `os.chdir()` do?
   - `os.getcwd()` returns the current working directory.
   - `os.chdir()` changes the current working directory to the path provided as an argument.

4. What are the `.` and `..` folders?
   - The `.` folder refers to the current directory.
   - The `..` folder refers to the parent directory.

5. In `C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt` which part is the dir name and which part is the base name?
   - `C:\bacon\eggs\` is the directory name, and `spam.txt` is the base name (the file name).

6. What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the `open()` function?
   - The three mode arguments are:
     - `'r'` for reading,
     - `'w'` for writing (creates or overwrites a file),
     - `'a'` for appending (adds to the end of the file).

7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?
   - If an existing file is opened in write mode (`'w'`), the contents of the file are erased, and a new file is created.

8. How do you tell the difference between `read()` and `readlines()`?
   - `read()` reads the entire content of a file as a single string.
   - `readlines()` reads the file line by line and returns a list of strings, where each string represents a line in the file.

9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?
   - A shelf value resembles a dictionary, where keys are strings, and values can be any Python object.
