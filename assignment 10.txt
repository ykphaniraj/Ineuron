assignment 10


1. **How do you distinguish between `shutil.copy()` and `shutil.copytree()`?**
   - `shutil.copy()` copies a single file from a source location to a destination.
   - `shutil.copytree()` recursively copies an entire directory tree, including all files and subdirectories.

2. **What function is used to rename files?**
   - The `os.rename()` function is used to rename files (or move them to a different location).

3. **What is the difference between the delete functions in the `send2trash` and `shutil` modules?**
   - `send2trash.send2trash()` sends files or directories to the operating system's trash/recycle bin.
   - `shutil.rmtree()` and `os.remove()` (in the `shutil` module) permanently delete files or directories without sending them to the trash, meaning the deletion is immediate and not recoverable.

4. **ZipFile objects have a `close()` method just like File objects’ `close()` method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ `open()` method?**
   - The `ZipFile()` constructor is equivalent to a File object's `open()` method. It is used to open a zip file for reading or writing.
   ```python
   with ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
       # work with the zip file
   ```

5. **Create a program that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as `.pdf` or `.jpg`). Copy these files from wherever they are to a new folder.**

Here is a Python program to accomplish this:

```python
import os
import shutil

def search_and_copy_files(src_folder, dest_folder, file_extension):
    # Create destination folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(dest_folder):
        os.makedirs(dest_folder)
    
    # Walk through the folder tree
    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(src_folder):
        for filename in filenames:
            if filename.endswith(file_extension):
                # Full path of the source file
                src_file = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
                # Copy file to destination
                shutil.copy(src_file, dest_folder)
                print(f"Copied: {src_file} to {dest_folder}")

# Example usage
src_folder = '/path/to/source/folder'
dest_folder = '/path/to/destination/folder'
file_extension = '.pdf'  # Change this to the desired extension

search_and_copy_files(src_folder, dest_folder, file_extension)
```

This program will search through all subdirectories in the `src_folder` for files with the specified `file_extension` and copy them to the `dest_folder`. You can modify the `src_folder`, `dest_folder`, and `file_extension` variables as needed.
