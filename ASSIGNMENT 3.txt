assignment 3

1. Advantages of Functions:  
   Functions allow code reuse, modularity, and easier debugging.

2. Function Code Execution:  
   Code in a function runs only when the function is called, not when it's defined.

3. Function Creation Statement:  
   The `def` statement creates a function in Python.

4. Function vs. Function Call:  
   A function is the block of code, and a function call is the execution of that code.

5. Global and Local Scopes:  
   There is one global scope, and each function call creates a new local scope.

6. Local Variables After Function Returns:  
   Local variables are destroyed when the function call ends.

7. Return Value Concept:  
   A return value is the result of a function, and it can be used in expressions.

8. No Return Statement:  
   If a function has no return statement, it returns `None`.

9. Referencing Global Variable:  
   Use the `global` keyword to refer to a global variable within a function.

10. Data Type of `None`:  
   The data type of `None` is `NoneType`.
