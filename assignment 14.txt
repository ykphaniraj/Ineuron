assignment 14


1. What does RGBA stand for?  
   - RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, Alpha. The Alpha channel represents the transparency level, where 0 is fully transparent and 255 is fully opaque.

2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any image?  
   - You can use the `getpixel()` method from the Pillow module. Example:
     ```python
     from PIL import Image
     img = Image.open('image.png')
     rgba_value = img.convert("RGBA").getpixel((x, y))
     ```
     This converts the image to RGBA and retrieves the pixel's RGBA value at position `(x, y)`.

3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?  
   - A box tuple is a 4-tuple that defines a rectangular region in an image. It is structured as `(left, upper, right, lower)` where:
     - `left`: x-coordinate of the left edge,
     - `upper`: y-coordinate of the top edge,
     - `right`: x-coordinate of the right edge,
     - `lower`: y-coordinate of the bottom edge.
     This defines the rectangular area to be used in methods like cropping.

4. How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?  
   - You can find the width and height using the `size` attribute of an Image object:
     ```python
     width, height = img.size
     ```

5. What method would you call to get an Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?  
   - You would use the `crop()` method with a box tuple that excludes the lower-left quarter:
     ```python
     cropped_img = img.crop((50, 0, 100, 50))
     ```

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?  
   - You can save the modified image using the `save()` method:
     ```python
     img.save('new_image.png')
     ```

7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?  
   - Pillow’s shape-drawing code is in the `ImageDraw` module.

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?  
   - A `Draw` object from the `ImageDraw` module has drawing methods. You get this object by calling `ImageDraw.Draw()` on an Image object:
     ```python
     from PIL import ImageDraw
     draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
     draw.line((0, 0, 100, 100), fill="red")
     ```
