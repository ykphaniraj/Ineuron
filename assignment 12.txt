assignment 12

1. **In what modes should the `PdfFileReader()` and `PdfFileWriter()` File objects be opened?**
   - For `PdfFileReader()`, the file should be opened in binary read mode (`'rb'`).
   - For `PdfFileWriter()`, the file should be opened in binary write mode (`'wb'`).

2. **From a `PdfFileReader` object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?**
   - You can use the `getPage(4)` method (since page numbers are zero-indexed) to get the Page object for page 5.
   ```python
   page = pdfReader.getPage(4)
   ```

3. **What `PdfFileReader` variable stores the number of pages in the PDF document?**
   - The `numPages` attribute stores the number of pages in the PDF document.
   ```python
   num_pages = pdfReader.numPages
   ```

4. **If a `PdfFileReader` object’s PDF is encrypted with the password `swordfish`, what must you do before you can obtain Page objects from it?**
   - You must decrypt the PDF using the `decrypt()` method and provide the password (`'swordfish'`) before accessing the pages.
   ```python
   pdfReader.decrypt('swordfish')
   ```

5. **What methods do you use to rotate a page?**
   - You can use `rotateClockwise()` and `rotateCounterClockwise()` methods to rotate a page by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively.

6. **What is the difference between a `Run` object and a `Paragraph` object?**
   - A `Paragraph` object represents a single paragraph of text, whereas a `Run` object is a section of text within a paragraph that shares the same formatting. A paragraph can contain multiple runs.

7. **How do you obtain a list of `Paragraph` objects for a `Document` object that’s stored in a variable named `doc`?**
   - You can obtain a list of `Paragraph` objects using the `doc.paragraphs` attribute.
   ```python
   paragraphs = doc.paragraphs
   ```

8. **What type of object has `bold`, `underline`, `italic`, `strike`, and `outline` variables?**
   - A `Run` object has these formatting variables.

9. **What is the difference between `False`, `True`, and `None` for the `bold` variable?**
   - `False`: The text is not bold.
   - `True`: The text is bold.
   - `None`: The text has the default bold setting (depends on the style applied).

10. **How do you create a `Document` object for a new Word document?**
    - You can create a new `Document` object using:
    ```python
    doc = Document()
    ```

11. **How do you add a paragraph with the text 'Hello, there!' to a `Document` object stored in a variable named `doc`?**
    - You can add the paragraph using the `add_paragraph()` method:
    ```python
    doc.add_paragraph('Hello, there!')
    ```

12. **What integers represent the levels of headings available in Word documents?**
    - The integers 0 through 9 represent the heading levels, with 0 being the highest level (typically title) and 1-9 representing descending heading levels.
