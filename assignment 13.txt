1. Advantages of Excel spreadsheets over CSV spreadsheets:
   - Formatting and Style: Excel spreadsheets allow for complex formatting (e.g., fonts, colors, borders) and styling, while CSV files are plain text and don't support these features.
   - Formulas and Functions: Excel supports built-in formulas, functions, and calculations, which CSV files don't.
   - Multiple Sheets: Excel supports multiple sheets within a single workbook, while CSV files are limited to single sheets.
   - Data Types: Excel can store different data types like numbers, dates, percentages, and text, and preserves the data types, whereas CSV files treat all data as plain text.
   - Data Validation and Security: Excel allows for data validation, password protection, and encryption, which CSV files do not offer.
   - Charts and Visuals: Excel can store charts, graphs, and pivot tables, while CSV files cannot store visual representations of data.

2. What do you pass to `csv.reader()` and `csv.writer()` to create reader and writer objects?  
   - You pass a file object (opened using Pythonâ€™s `open()` function) to both `csv.reader()` and `csv.writer()`.

3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?  
   - For reader objects, the file should be opened in 'r' (read) mode.  
   - For writer objects, the file should be opened in 'w' (write) mode.

4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?  
   - The `writerow()` method of the `csv.writer` object takes a list as an argument and writes it to a CSV file.

5. What do the keyword arguments `delimiter` and `lineterminator` do?
   - The `delimiter` argument specifies the character that separates fields (e.g., a comma `,` or a semicolon `;`).
   - The `lineterminator` argument specifies the string that should be used to terminate lines (e.g., `'\n'` for a newline or `'\r\n'` for Windows-style line breaks).

6. What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?  
   - The `json.loads()` function takes a string of JSON data and returns a corresponding Python data structure (e.g., a dictionary or list).

7. What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?  
   - The `json.dumps()` function takes a Python data structure and returns a JSON-formatted string.
